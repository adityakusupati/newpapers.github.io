# Summary

> “An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.”

# Organizing committee

[**Krishna Murthy**](https://krrish94.github.io/) is a PhD student at Mila and the Robotics and Embodied AI Lab, advised by Liam Paull. His research strives to develop embodied agents that perceive, reason, and act intelligently.

[**Bhairav Mehta**](https://bhairavmehta95.github.io/) is a PhD student at MIT working with Max Tegmark, woring on optimization and multi-task learning of deep neural networks, especially in sequential learning, reinforcement learning, and non-iid data settings. 

[**Tegan Maharaj**](http://www.teganmaharaj.com/) is a PhD student at Mila, advised by Chris Pal. Her recent research aims to bring together the fields of deep learning and theoretical ecology with active projects in ecosystem modeling and deep networks, including work collecting datasets, in multi-agent RL, counterfactual inference, and meta-learning. 

[**Amy Tabb**](https://amytabb.com/) is a researcher working at the intersection of computer vision, robotics, agricultural automation, and plant phenotyping. She develops algorithms and systems to perceive aspects of plants for agricultural automation and plant phenotyping using computer vision and robotics.

[**Khimya Khetarpal**](https://kkhetarpal.wordpress.com/) is a PhD student at the McGill Reasoning and Learning Lab, advised by Doina Precup, whose research spans reinforcement learning, computer vision, and robotics. She is working towards building systems that are able to perceive the world similar to human perception allowing them to reinforce learning and evolve with time just like humans. 

[**Aditya Kusupati**](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~kusupati/) is PhD student at University of Washington jointly advised by Ali Farhadi and Sham Kakade. His research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and robotics.

[**Breandan Considine**](https://breandan.net/) is a PhD student at McGill University, advised by Jin Guo. His research studies the relationship between software and machine learning, to reason about the behavior of real-world programs and use those insights to build more intelligent programming tools for developers.

[**Devi Parikh**](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/) is an Associate Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, and a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Research. Her research interests are in computer vision, natural language processing, embodied AI, human-AI collaboration, and AI for creativity.
